# canvas-tag
 Canvas Tag is a simple online game of the playground classic. You control your player with WASD. Moving off the screen causes you to loop around to the other side (Pacman style). The green player is "It", which means they need to tag someone. Canvas Tag is made using HTML5 canvas, Vue, Socket.io, NodeJS, and Express.
